# Automation Tools

## How to run bots on various browsers

### ðŸ”» In Chrome

- The Chrome runs on chromium and the chrome driver is required for the selenium webdirver to "drive" the web UI 
- Get the latest chrome driver installed from [here](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
- Download the selenium-webdriver and make sure the version is compatible with your chromeâ€™s version
- Choose the language you are going to write a script with require the webdriver for the chrome
- Chrome is probably the most easily suited for automation for almost all of the tools

### ðŸ”» In Firefox

- The Firefox runs on gecko engine and the gecko driver is required for the selenium webdirver to "drive" the web UI 
- Get the latest gecko driver installed from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/)
- Download the zip or taz file
- Extract and include in the path
- For more references visit this [page](https://askubuntu.com/questions/870530/how-to-install-geckodriver-in-ubuntu)

### ðŸ”» In Brave

- Since the Brave basically runs on Chromium, it has pretty much the same deps as Chrome
- Make sure you give the right executable path (/usr/bin/brave-browser) for the options parameter

### ðŸ”» In Safari

- Similar to chrome and firefox, safari is pretty much an available browser for the automation tool to hit on
- Before running a bot script on safari, make sure to run this  `safaridriver --enable` in the terminal
- For testing with linux and windows however, try installing safari in a virtual box

[Is it possible to install Safari on Ubuntu 14.04?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/676496/is-it-possible-to-install-safari-on-ubuntu-14-04)

### ðŸ”» In Internet Explorer

- Though a minority of people use Internet Explorer that does not mean any bot would try to hit in it
- Hence the IE is also vulnerable to the bot attacks
- However very few automation tools seem to support IE and they are not quite stable in the recent versions

# Lists of Automation Tools

## Note:

- Selenium-webdriver will often throw an error saying its chrome webdriver is not compatible with the latest version of chrome browser. So everytime there is a SessionNotCreated Error, we have to manually download the latest chromdriver for the current chrome version and extract it into the right directory. 

- Refer [this](https://medium.com/fusionqa/selenium-webdriver-error-sessionnotcreatederror-session-not-created-this-version-of-7b3a8acd7072) for more instuctions

- In case of firefox browser, we would need the geckodriver to be dowloaded from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/)
